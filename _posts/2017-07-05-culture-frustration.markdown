It's not uncommon to hear, from persons that relocated to a new country,
discussions related to the dissatisfactions with the new land they've
set upon or the land they've just left behind.

Apart from the stifling reply, "they're just not used to it", what else
is hiding behind this phenomenon.

Let's dissect this case.


The discussion usually takes two sides, the side of someone emerging
from a society to another for more opportunities, or the side of
someone looking for the discovery (or re-discovery) of cultural roots
and communions in another society.

This is not limited to those cases but those are frequent enough to
deserve mentioning above all else.

It is important to note the reasons that made the persons move because
context is everything.

With it we frame our behavior and future interpretations.


We start our journey with a luggage provided by the society we come from,
or so we think.

We take lenses out of this luggage and begin our frustrated appraisal
of the views that are newly presented.

Colors seem to be confounded, some missing, some distorted. The
combinations and arrangements appear distasteful.

This isn't the order of things we're *used to*.

This may be or may not be what we've heard the order of things *would*
be like.

This isn't how *it's supposed to be*.

We feel like everyone is *out of place*.


...


We all think that the way we live is the best way to live.

We all think that we see the world as it is, that we've come to the best
possible conclusion about our direction in life.

However, that's just our definition of normality.

And this normality isn't even *ours* as most of it happens without us
being there.

We often can't justify why we do what we do or why we like what we like.

Emotions come first and justifications later.

What is normal? How to redefine it?

Let's go back to our disgruntled traveler which might utter the following
exclamations:

* "There is a lack of freedom here!"
* "Why can't everyone keep it to themselves?"
* "You can't have your own personality and be diversified here."
* "Those rituals are so barbaric and useless, just a waste of money!"
* "I want to talk to individuals, I don't want to talk with networks".

Or

* "Everything is too practical and utilitarian, where's humanity?"
* "Nobody asks me about my life! Nobody cares!"
* "I feel left alone, there's nothing to be part of!"
* "Friendship isn't *real* here. Everything is goal oriented."
* "There's nothing sacred here."

Those are some of the relevant superficialities that jumps out when
hearing the "frustrated" conversations.

One side is perceived by the other as restricting freedom and individual
choices, the other as being selfish and not respecting the greater goods.

Why should we have to live as single individuals, for one's own goals
and interests, how will the group thrive, what's my purpose if there's
no higher order call - one side may say.

How will I socialize if there's no starting point of trust with each
others, if they aren't part of my "clan" of beliefs.

Why should we be judged based on our religious views, political views,
or network of relations - another side may say.

Why live in an environment where I'm perceived as my inherited beliefs,
and other superfluous attributes that I can't control, instead of who
I want to be and create myself as.

The new mentality appears different and frightening - different acting,
different social dynamics, different manner of building the "self",
different definition of who we are within the society.

In addition, we hate being wrong and we like confirmation.

We create a cocoon and hide ourselves in it repeating the hokum over
and over again.

And we are afraid of the unknown - afraid that the stable self we've
built to be part of a society is not a self that could partake and feel
comfortable in the activities of another society.

However, those last three sentences are wrong. Whenever we hear the
frustrated discussion it means that the person hasn't reached the state
of fear but is in complete disillusion.

We're blind to our own views and when this isn't the case then fear
takes on.

Fear is uncertainty.

It's frightful to have society lift us up as a way to construct ourselves
and then suddenly loosing this cherished society.

It's also frightful to have this sense of self-direction and suddenly
have to adhere to rules and morals to get around in the new society.

To go past this we have to stop constructing ourselves as the vision
and start being the authors and selectors of parts within visions taken
amongst the panoply of available ones.

This sounds complex...

Where do we start if our own perceptions are erroneous?  
Where's the true best society?  

Reading this article is a start in itself. We need to ask questions and
take angles at issues we haven't thought about before.

This can't be done alone, it requires contact with others and their
environment because it's rarely ourselves that can reveal our assumptions.

It might be difficult to wear the persona of someone else but less
tedious to reach a level of appreciation and respect.

To an extent, this means we'll have to loosen the tight tie with the
culture that nurtured us. To move it from an inherent section of ourself
to something we own instead.

It takes time to be engulfed in the fluidity of cultures and even more
to start belonging to one of them, at least for a short period of time.

Let's reiterate:

The selfishness is not about selfishness but an embrace to
self-direction. Egoist is not the same as egotistic. The culture "asks"
this from its members to function well.

The communality is not about barbaric and useless rituals but an embrace
of shared bounds and respect, a strong base that everyone relies upon. The
culture "asks" this from its members to function well.

So every culture has their standards?  
Should we let them be?  
What about me?

Cultural diversity doesn't rhyme with pureness and cleanliness, it's
not about separation nor appropriation.

When choosing to be part of it we're not obliged to succumb, morph
and agree.

Furthermore, it's not all relativism and subjectivity where everyone likes
what they like, do as they do, and don't intermix. There are limits and
truth in the vagueness, because most of it is unwritten social agreements,
to guide us on our path.

It doesn't have to be a binary choice either: we can be part of multiple
cultures and juggle with them.

This is called cultural sharing: individuals willingly choosing the
parts of diversity to create a plurality of cultures within themselves.

Certainly, the number of values they can pursue is finite and that
discrete factor makes the choice even more deliberate and when pursuing
and reaching for new limits there always need to be room for the
possibility of human understanding.


Now let's stop for a while and think about everything we've described
thus far. Take a step back.

Let's think about our own case or the case of our friends.

What we've mentioned is not entirely true.

The real truth is that the moralities, world-views, and constructions
of the self of the persons with higher education within any society
are more adhering together than with the views of the host country;
their perception of the self is about self-authorship.

The opposite is also true, individuals lower on the social class and
without education are more similar altogether world-wide; their perception
of the self is about self definition via communality.

It's not that countries differ in their essence but that the demands of
the way the citizen builds him/herself in it differs.

Less modern societies have less demands of its individuals and provide
an in-place system to direct them.

Modern societies moves the burden on the individuals and asks of them
to provide the structure and system for themselves, it is not intrinsic.

Some persons are more inclined to feel that their home country is not
apt at fulfilling their needs. Be it because we think it's not offering
the support it should, or be it because we think it doesn't offer the
liberty that we would like.

What modern and less modern societies have in common is that they both
need a system, structure, and order.

Nonetheless, deliberate choices are heavy and stressful.

Delegating the role of systematization to the country instead of the
self makes it less painful.

The citizens don't have to find their own meanings, don't have to find
their own goals, don't have to find their own roles.


There's already something predestined for them, a "perfect plan".

Community, religious, political, gender, professional.

And when someone with that mindset moves to a country where they *are*
required to define their own self then it seems as if everything is out
of place, that everyone is selfish and that no one cares.

And when someone with the other mindset moves, usually in vacations,
to a country with predefined rules, they may feel as if everyone wants
to tamper with what they've created as their structure. Though this
reverse case is less frequent than the previous one.

Both try to find what they've left in what they're discovering: their
assumptions.

What would be convenient is to take both approach as external and not
internal. We can entwine group bounding within a structure and system
that we've particularly chosen from a set of plurality and cultural
sharing. This while still remaining open to suggestion and knowing that
all those are on the fringe of ourself and not defining who we are.


In conclusion, if you can take away an idea from this article it's that,
we need to stay playful with the expansion of our mind. To take whatever
we know lightly and detach it from how we define ourselves - To have
fun questioning our views.

We need to increase the diversity within us and to do that we need more
uncertainty and conflicts.

All of that while being deliberate, the only intention and motivation
is to be open to possibilities.

Cheers my fellow mind travelers!

## Addendum ##

Here's a metaphoric reply I left to someone that was feeling such cultural
frustration, it might be more meaningful than this whole post.

Suffocation comes from a feeling of being repressed, imprisoned, limited.
The reason for that might be that you feel you've reached the end of a
road where you see no other alternative paths, at least paths that you
don't see you can fit into. I can relate to that, it's uneasy and painful.

You want to run away from this road to one that you've seen is already
paved and well maintained.

However that other road requires from you, to be able to navigate
it, a new mode of transportation, maybe something you are not used
to. Something that requires way more from you then you require from
the road itself. It's high speed traffic. It might be as frightening as
staying in the prison-state-of-mind.

When you have easy alleys here, though unmaintained, it's roads that
you walk on foot, a lot of the time avoiding potholes. It feels weird
and hard to navigate the narrow and potholed infrastructures using a
mode of transportation suited for the high speed traffic. You might
feel limited and even crushed, looked at by everyone as the weirdo who
doesn't accommodate. You might even feel pressured to just give up what
you think defines who you are, the way you move in the world.

It's the same way in reverse, you can't walk on foot on the big
infrastructures provided for high speed traffic. The burden is all on
you, no one is going to stop to have a discussion about which path you
should take, you're on your own to decide your destiny. You might feel
alone when everyone is in their vehicle going their way, past you, not
giving a glance. At least it might be what you think from the perspective
of the one on foot.

Think about that, maybe this metaphor is far fetched but it's as close
a feeling I could come up with. I have no clue where you stand and I'm
not here to judge. However you have to realize that your suffocation
comes from a discrepancy between how you perceive the world should be
and how it is.

Your prison is your own vision. You don't have to picture the environment
as a road imposed on you, that you have to move on and with. Roads are
there for a reason, it doesn't mean you should feel pressured by what's
happening on them nor that you should want the road to change for your
own way of progressing.

What is required from the road is required by the most number of persons
using it.

They are there to use, not for them to be imposed on you, nor to make
you feel imprisoned. They are there for you to make the most use of
them. What you see as non-functional has some functionalities you might
not see at the moment and I'm not going to give a lecture on that, you
probably don't want to hear that. What you want to hear is that there
are high speed roads alongside the alleys, and yes there are, everywhere,
you just have to find them and the people on them.. And there are alleys
next to high speed roads, so if you feel like you can't keep up with
the pace you can take refuge in them.
